## 🎤 30-Second Elevator Pitches

### CATrix
"Full-stack CAT exam prep platform with JWT auth, PostgreSQL backend, and 25 REST APIs. Features mock tests, real-time analytics, and admin workflows. Migrated from Supabase for full control."

### Dictovo
"Vocabulary building app with OCR and PDF parsing. Upload images or PDFs, extract words automatically, take quizzes. Google OAuth + JWT auth. MongoDB backend with smart caching."

### InSaito (Internship Project)
"Data analytics platform built during internship. Upload CSV/PDF → automatic parsing → statistical analysis → interactive visualizations → downloadable reports. Solves manual data analysis problem."

### SmartBundle (ML-Powered)
"E-commerce platform using Apriori algorithm for smart product bundling. Role-based (Creator/Teacher/Student) → optimized bundles → bulk discounts. Product thinking + ML."

### StockSense (ML-Powered)
"Stock analysis platform with ensemble ML (4 models). 40+ technical indicators, real-time data, SMS alerts. Democratizes financial analysis for retail investors."

## 🎯 Interview Questions & Answers

### Q: "Tell me about your most complex project."
**A:** "SmartBundle - combines full-stack development with ML. Used Apriori algorithm for association rule mining to create intelligent product bundles. Analyzes support, confidence, and lift metrics to optimize recommendations. Demonstrates both technical depth and product thinking."

### Q: "Have you worked on production systems?"
**A:** "Yes, CATrix has production-ready architecture with 25 REST APIs, 8-table PostgreSQL schema, JWT auth with 7-day expiration, and comprehensive error handling. Also deployed 4 projects live on Vercel and Streamlit Cloud."

### Q: "What's your experience with ML?"
**A:** "Two ML projects: StockSense uses ensemble methods (4 models) for stock prediction with 40+ technical indicators. SmartBundle uses Apriori algorithm for product bundling. Both solve real-world problems with measurable impact."

### Q: "Describe a project you built from scratch."
**A:** "InSaito during my internship. Identified problem: users struggling with manual data analysis. Built full-stack solution: CSV/PDF upload → parsing → statistical analysis → visualizations → PDF reports. Reduced analysis time from hours to minutes."
